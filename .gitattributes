;In this code, we have a list of file patterns and their corresponding linguist settings. The `linguist-generated` setting indicates that the files are generated by the build process and should not be counted as code. The `linguist-vendored` setting indicates that the files are vendored (i.e., third-party) files and should not be counted as code.
