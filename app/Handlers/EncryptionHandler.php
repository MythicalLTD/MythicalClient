 * 
 * Cautionary Note: Exercise discretion when handling this file, as any modifications made without a comprehensive understanding of its functionality could lead to unintended consequences.
 * 
 * It's crucial to comprehend that this file plays a pivotal role in ensuring the security and confidentiality of user settings stored in the database. 
 * The mechanism it employs is akin to end-to-end encryption, providing an unparalleled level of protection.
 * The data is transformed into an unreadable format using a specific key, meticulously configured within the confines of the 'config.yml' file.
 * 
 * It is of paramount importance to underscore that altering the encryption key without a profound understanding of the implications can result in detrimental outcomes. 
 * Specifically, this action has the potential to disrupt the encryption and decryption processes. 
 * In such a scenario, the historical data, which was initially safeguarded using the previous key, would become irrecoverable.
 * 
 * In light of these intricacies, it is advised that only individuals with an extensive grasp of the encryption mechanisms and key management delve into the modification of this file. 
 * Without the requisite knowledge, well-intentioned efforts to enhance the system could inadvertently lead to the loss of critical data. 
 * Thus, the utmost caution and expertise are indispensable when engaging with this pivotal component of the system.
